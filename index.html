              <h2>Mercury</h2>
              <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. <br>
                 It has a very thin atmosphere, which causes extreme temperature fluctuations. <br>
                 The surface temperature can reach up to 800°F (430°C) during the day and drop to -330°F (-201°C) at night.

              <h2>Venus</h2>
              <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. <br>
                 Known as Earth's twin due to its similar size, it has a thick atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.<br>
                 Thus creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the solar system. 
                 The surface temperature averages 900°F (475°C).

              <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. <br>
                 It has a breathable atmosphere, a liquid water surface, and a temperate climate. <br>
                 Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon.

              <h2>Mars</h2>
              <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. <br>
                 The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". <br>
                 Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing.

              <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the solar system. <br>
                 It is a gas giant with a thick atmosphere made primarily of hydrogen and helium. <br>
                 Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for centuries.

              <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun.<br>
                 It is unique for its tilted rotation axis, causing it to spin on its side. <br>
                 The planet's atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a blue-green color.

              <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. <br>
                 It has a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. <br>
                 Neptune is known for its strong winds and large storms, including the Great Dark Spot, which is similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.
